<!-- https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/registering-elements.html#host-attributes
If a custom elements needs HTML attributes set on it at create-time, these may
be declared in a hostAttributes property on the prototype, where keys are the
attribute name and values are the values to be assigned. Values should typically
be provided as strings, as HTML attributes can only be strings; however, the
standard serialize method is used to convert values to strings, so true will
serialize to an empty attribute, and false will result in no attribtue set,
and so forth (see Attribute serialization for more details). --><html><head><script type="application/dart" src="6.static-attributes-on-host.bootstrap.initialize.dart"></script>

<!--Note: As of Polymer 0.9, the class attribute canâ€™t be configured using
hostAttributes.--></head><body></body></html>
