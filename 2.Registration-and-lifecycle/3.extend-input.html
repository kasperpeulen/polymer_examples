<!--Polymer currently only supports extending native HTML elements (for example,
 input, or button, as opposed to extending other custom elements, which will be
  supported in a future release). These native element extensions are called type
  extension custom elements.--><!--To extend a native HTML element, set the extends property on your prototype
to the tag name of the element to extend.--><html><head><script type="application/dart" src="3.extend-input.bootstrap.initialize.dart"></script>

<!--To use a type-extension element in markup, use the native tag and add an is
 attribute that specifies the extension type name:-->
