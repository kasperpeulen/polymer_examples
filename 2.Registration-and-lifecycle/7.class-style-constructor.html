<!-- If you want to set up your custom elementâ€™s prototype chain but not register it
immediately, you can use the  Polymer.Class function. Polymer.Class takes the
same prototype argument as the Polymer function, and sets up the prototype chain,
but does not register the element. Instead it returns a constructor that can be
passed to document.registerElement to register your element with the browser,
and after which can be used to instantiate new instances of your element via code.
