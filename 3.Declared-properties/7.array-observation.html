<!--Finally, to observe mutations to arrays (changes resulting from calls to push, pop, shift, unshift, and splice, generally referred to as “splices”), specify a path to an array followed by .splices as an argument to the observer function.

The value received by the observer for the splices path of an array is a change records with the following properties:

indexSplices. Lists the set of changes that occurred to the array, in terms of array indicies. Each indexSplices record contains the following properties:

index. Position where the splice started.
removed. Array of removed items.
addedCount. Number of new items inserted at index.
keySplices. Lists the set of changes that occurred to the array in terms of “keys” used by Polymer for identifying array elements. Each keySplices record contains the following properties:

added. Array of added keys.
removed. Array of removed keys.
