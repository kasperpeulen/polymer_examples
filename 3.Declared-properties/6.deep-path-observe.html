<!-- To call an observer when any (deep) sub-property of an object changes,
specify a path with a wildcard (*).

When you specify a path with a wildcard, the argument passed to your observer is
a change record object with the following properties:

* path. Path to the property that changed.
* value. New value of the path that changed.
* base. The object matching the non-wildcard portion of the path.--><html><head><script type="application/dart" src="6.deep-path-observe.bootstrap.initialize.dart"></script></head><body></body></html>
