<!--To observe changes to a set of properties, use the observers array.

These observers differ from single-property observers in a few ways:

* Observers are not invoked until once all dependent properties are defined
(!== undefined). So each dependent properties should have a default value
defined in properties (or otherwise be initialized to a non-undefined value)
to ensure the observer is called.

* Observers do not receive old values as arguments, only new values. Only
single-property observers defined in the properties object receive both old and
new values.

<!--In addition to properties, observers can also observe paths to
sub-properties, paths with wildcards, or array changes.--></head><body></body></html>
